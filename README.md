# Kaggle-Competition-Regression-Analysis-for-US-Patents
This repository contains the code used to implement ridge regression. Used only 50% of data for model evaluation due to lack of computational capability.

Task: Perform Regression analysis and predict forward citations a patent will receive.

Data: US Patent Data - USPTO 

Objective: Predict the number of forward citations a patent will receive.

Model: Ridge Regression with hyper-parameter tuning

Best Hyperparameters: {'alpha': 10, 'copy_X': True, 'fit_intercept': True, 'max_iter': 10, 'normalize': False}

Test Score of Model: 0.23
